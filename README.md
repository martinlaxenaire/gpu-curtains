# gpu-curtains

> :warning: WIP

#### WebGPU rendering engine

gpu-curtains is a small, lightweight WebGPU rendering engine library.

Although it can theoretically be used as a genuine 3D engine, its main purpose is to turn HTML elements into textured planes, allowing you to animate them via WGSL shaders.

The project was initially conceived as a WebGPU port of [curtains.js](https://github.com/martinlaxenaire/curtainsjs). It turned out to be a complete rewrite of the library instead, but with a very similar API.

### Roadmap

See the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for details on the current work in progress.
