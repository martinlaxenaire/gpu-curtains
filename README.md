# gpu-curtains

> :warning: WIP

gpu-curtains is an attempt at rewriting [curtains.js](https://github.com/martinlaxenaire/curtainsjs) in WebGPU.

The library has been rewritten to the core, so it is not just a port of the existing codebase but instead a new version based on the original concept.


See the [project roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for details on the work in progress.
